Run these tests from the project root directory using
 
  $ pytest-3 tests/test_*.py 

pytest-3 is the standard Python 3 test runner. On Debian systems, it is part of the
python3-pytest package.

This directory also contains some scripts that are not unit tests and cannot be
run using pytest: test.py, fill_database.py and sim_clients.py. The latter two
scripts are used for performance testing.
